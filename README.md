# Dynamic-pricing-parking
üöó Dynamic pricing engine for urban parking lots using Python, Pathway &amp; Bokeh. Built by Mohit Upadhyay for Summer Analytics 2025 by Consulting &amp; Analytics Club √ó Pathway.

This project demonstrates dynamic pricing using occupancy data, demand features, competitor context, and live simulation using Pathway & Bokeh.

## üìå Objective

Urban parking is often underpriced or overpriced due to static pricing systems. This project aims to:

- Design dynamic pricing models using real-world features
- Simulate pricing in real-time
- Visualize prices across parking lots
- Make pricing reactive to competition and demand

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **Pathway** for real-time stream simulation
- **Bokeh** for live visualization
- **Google Colab** for development
- **GitHub** for version control

## üß† Models Implemented

### ‚úÖ Model 1: Linear Pricing Based on Occupancy

Price increases proportionally with occupancy using a basic formula:

\[
\text{Price} = \text{Base} + \alpha \cdot \left( \frac{\text{Occupancy}}{\text{Capacity}} \right)
\]

- Base Price = $10  
- Alpha (Œ±) = 1.0  
- Capped between $5 and $20

### ‚úÖ Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing

Incorporates real-world demand signals:
- Occupancy rate
- Queue length
- Traffic condition nearby
- Is it a special day?
- Vehicle type (bike/car/truck)

\[
\text{Final Price} = \text{Base} \cdot \left(1 + \lambda \cdot \text{NormalizedDemand} \right)
\]

- Lambda (Œª) = 0.8  
- Price clipped between $5 and $20

### ‚úÖ Model 3: Competitive Pricing Adjustment

Accounts for pricing of nearby competitors using geolocation (lat/lon) and the **Haversine distance formula**.

Logic:
- If nearby lots are cheaper ‚Üí reduce your price
- If you're cheaper or isolated ‚Üí slight increase
- Radius used: 1 km

### ‚úÖ Model 4: Real-Time Simulation with Pathway

We simulate a live stream of parking data using Pathway by:
- Streaming 100 rows of data
- Applying a custom `@pw.udf` to compute real-time price
- Outputting to the notebook with `pw.debug.compute_and_print(...)`

üß™ Stream sample generated from: `dataset.csv`

---

### ‚úÖ Model 5: Bokeh Interactive Visualization

Used Bokeh to create an interactive line plot of Model 2 prices across 50 parking lots. Ideal for real-time dashboards.
